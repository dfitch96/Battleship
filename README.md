# Battleship
## Overview
This is a classic Battleship game built with JavaScript. The game follows the principles of Test-Driven Development (TDD) and includes a player-controlled board as well as an intelligent computer AI opponent. The project is part of __The Odin Project's__ curriculum and focuses on modular design and game logic implementation.

## Features
- __Ship Placement:__ Players can manually place ships or randomly generate their placements.
- __Gameboard Management:__ Tracks ship locations, missed shots, and hits.
- __Turn-Based Gameplay:__ Players take turns attacking the opponent's board.
- __AI Opponent:__ The computer makes intelligent moves, avoiding duplicate attacks and prioritizing adjacent targets after a hit.
- __Endgame Condition:__ The game ends when all ships of a player are sunk.
- __User Interface:__ A graphical interface displays both player and computer gameboards, updating dynamically with game progress.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git@github.com:dfitch96/Battleship.git
2. Install Dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install

## Game Rules
1. Players start by placing ships on a 10x10 grid.
2. Ships can be placed horizontally or vertically.
3. Players take turns selecting a coordinate to attack. If an attack successfully hits a ship, the player gets another turn. Otherwise, the turn passes to the opponent.
4. The opponentâ€™s board updates to reflect hits or misses.
5. The game continues until one player has no remaining ships.

## How It Works
- Ship Class: Defines ship properties (length, hit status, sunk status).
- Gameboard Class: Manages ship placement, tracking hits and misses.
- Player Class: Handles player and computer actions.
- Computer AI: Randomly selects moves but follows a logical strategy after a successful hit.
- DOM Module: Updates the UI dynamically based on game state.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement drag-and-drop ship placement.
- Add a two-player mode.
