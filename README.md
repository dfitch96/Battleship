## Overview
This is a classic Battleship game built with JavaScript. The game follows the principles of Test-Driven Development (TDD) and includes a player-controlled board as well as an intelligent computer AI opponent. The project is part of __The Odin Project's__ curriculum and focuses on modular design and game logic implementation.
